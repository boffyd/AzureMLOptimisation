# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**Problem Statement**
This dataset is a banking dataset, where we are seeking to classify whether or not a load is worth while pursuing, with the output being a binary Yes (Y) or No (N).  There are 21 variables including the target variable "y".

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
**Pipeline Architecture
The pipeline architectre loosely followed the below order.
1. Download dataset, in this case there was a predefined URL with  CSV
2. Preprocess the data.  The hyperdrive process included a custom script that allowed for pre-processing and cleaning of the data, splitting into test/train portions and then running a logistic model based on a hyperdrive parameter sampler.  The hyperdrive ran through a controlled search to optimise the model through various iterations, including an early termination rule (in this case bandit)

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
Random Parameter sampling has the advantage of being quick.  Typically grid searching is used to narrow done on a parameter zone, and users can then use Random numbers around this area for better effectiveness.

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**


## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
